description = '''
<p>If you have ever visited a canyon or a cave, you may have
    yelled and heard the echo of your own voice. In this problem,
    you should simulate that effect:</p>

<center>
      Hello! Hello! Hello!
    </center>

<p>Your program will be given as input a single word, and it
    should print out that word three times, separating the words
    with spaces.</p>
'''

input = '''
<p>Input is a single line, containing exactly one word. The
    only characters used are upper and/or lowercase letters (aâ€“z).
    The word contains at least one and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> characters.</p>

output = '''
<p>Output the given word three times, separated by spaces.</p>

template = '''
let input = readline();
