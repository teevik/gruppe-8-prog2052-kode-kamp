description = '''
<p>In this problem, your program should read two whole numbers
    (also called integers) from the input, and print them out in
    increasing order.</p>
'''

input = '''
<p>The input contains one line, which has two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, separated by a single space. The
    bounds on these values are <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le
    a, b \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
'''

output = '''
<p>Output the smaller number first, and the larger number
    second.</p>
'''

template = '''
let input = readline();

// console.log(output);
