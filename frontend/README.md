# Frontend

This is the **frontend part** of our application, built with React and Vite. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (with npm)

You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup and run

First we need to install all of the node modules with:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
npm i
```

After everything is installed we can run the application two ways,

## Only frontend

To only run the frontend part of our application we need to run

```bash
npm run dev
```

and we will get a local link, usually: http://localhost:5173/
Here we can navigate to our version of the application

## Frontend and backend

To run the frontend component with the backend, we need to open a second terminal and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

in the ./backend direcotry whilst we are running the fronend part in the ./frontend directory
